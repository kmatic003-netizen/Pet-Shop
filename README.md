The application is built using Java for backend logic, JavaScript for client-side interactivity, and HTML and CSS for frontend presentation.
Overall, this web application serves both as an academic demonstration of software development skills and as a foundation for potential future enhancements, such as integrating payment systems, user authentication, or more advanced inventory features.
